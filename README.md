# R course for data journalists from the school of data

In this project we want to create an online R course for journalists and data journalists. We focus on people who are used to working with spreadsheets (e.g. excel). The course will be available in the languages Spanish, French, German and English.

We think R is great for journalists all over the world because it is free, open source and helps cleaning data, analysing data and creating beautiful graphs and reports. So far resources for journalists to learn R are very limited and we want to help make R one of journalists' favorite tools :tada:


So far we created...

- The [proposal](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/proposal.md) 
we wrote for the R Consortium
- Templates for [data recipes](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/tree/master/r-package/inst/tutorials/en-recipe-template)
and [skills lessons](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/tree/master/r-package/inst/tutorials/en-skills-template). You can also check them out in R via
```
devtools::install_github("school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal", 
                         subdir="r-package")
learnr::run_tutorial("en-recipe-template", package = "ddj")
learnr::run_tutorial("en-skills-template", package = "ddj")
```
- The [intro lesson](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/material/lessons/Introduction.Rmd)
- A [data journalists view on R](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/material/lessons/why_use_R.md) by Timo Grossenbacher
- The following data recipes
    + [Switzerland dual use goods](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/material/lessons/switzerland-dual-use/recipe_switzerland-dual-use.Rmd)
     + [WIP - Visualisation of polls results during presidential election in France](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/r-package/inst/tutorials/en-recipe-france-presidentialelec-polls/en-recipe-france-presidentialelec-polls.Rmd)
- The following skills lessons 
    + NA
  
 But there is much more work to do and we need help!
