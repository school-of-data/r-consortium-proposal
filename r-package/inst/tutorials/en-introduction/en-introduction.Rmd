<!-- # Introductory steps - phase 1 -->

<!-- The introductory steps are a guided process through which: -->

<!-- * we spell out clearly how R can be used for a basic data story -->
<!-- * we introduce the reader to the basics of R, iterating on each notion learned in the previous step -->
<!-- * we contextualise the step within a data-driven story writing workflow. -->

## Introduction
_interactive quiz used as a way to start engaging the visitor right away, and to get statistics from various populations_

```{r q_journali, echo=FALSE}
question("Are you a journalist?",
  answer("Yes", correct = TRUE, message = "This course is for you!"),
  answer("No", correct = TRUE, message = "This tutorial is delibarately, intensely, exclusively focused on journalists. If that's ok with you, please feel free to take a look at the course :)"),
  correct = "Welcome!", incorrect = "Welcome!"
)
```

```{r q_heard, echo=FALSE}
question("Have you ever heard about R?",
  answer("Yes", correct = TRUE),
  answer("No", correct = TRUE),
  correct = "Welcome! This course is for you!", incorrect = "Welcome! This course is for you!"
)
```
Well, despite its mysterious and concise name, R is an open source programming
language and environment for statistical computing, widely used among data analysts, statisticians,
programmers and more recently, by data journalists.   Our mission today will be to convince you
that R is worth your precious time and will help you improve your work in the newsroom.

```{r q_use, echo=FALSE}
question("Do you already use R your work?",
  answer("Yes", correct = TRUE, message = "However, there is always something to learn, right?"),
  answer("No", correct = TRUE, message = "We think R is a great tool for journalists. Let's see if we can convince you."),
  correct = "Great! What follows is a beginner tutorial for R-newbies.", 
  incorrect = "Great! What follows is a beginner tutorial for R-newbies."
)
```

In the following we will show you a story that commonly comes up for journalists:
**post-election analysis**.
Our example are the Brexit votes.


## DEFINE

A referendum in your country is over and you are tasked to do a post-election analysis. You have data about the number of votes, demographics and geographic distribution of the votes.  In order to see what would make a good story, you decide to analyse and visualise the data.
Even though you normally work with spreadsheets, you want to try R.  Here are a few reasons why:

Spreadsheet | R
-------------------------------- | --------------------------------
It's a "point and click program" | You write a functions directly in the R interface and R does all the magic
If you want to repeat a process you have to do it every time | R allows for automation of processes that have to be repeated. Write once, reuse several times: Not only can you update your code easily, but you can easily share it with other projects.
Only allows some types of files | Can load different kinds of files that can be complicated or impossible to work with in a spreadsheet
Allows you to make some graphics, but you are limited by the program to what type and what do they look like | Allows you to customize every aspect of your visualization
You go through your analyzing process once and you can forget about making it immediately reproducible for someone else | Allows you to save the code through which you processed your database. This makes the whole methodology immediately reproducible by anyone else whom you shared the script with.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Wait_what.jpg")
```

To get started with this tutorial, you don't even have to install anything.
For now, you can just try stuff by writing code on this website. Let's try 
if that works. Please run the following code by clicking the `Run Code` button:
```{r try, exercise = TRUE}
3 + 5
```
For those of you who do want to install R, we recommend installing R and the
RStudio editor (for help, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-u_7vdag-0)). 

Not all R code chunks in the following will have
a `Run Code` button. If you want to reproduce the entire tutorial on your computer,
you have to copy also these code chunks.

In this lesson we will need a couple of add-on R-Packages.
To install the packages run:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("xlsx")
install.packages("foreign")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("gmodels")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("GGally")
install.packages("raster")
install.packages("maptools")
install.packages("broom")
install.packages("gpclib")
```
Please make sure, that non of these return an error message. If they do,
use the internet to find out what the error means and what to do to solve it by
copy-pasting the error into a search engine.
In 99 % of cases, someone else had the same error before you and someone
from the very friendly R community helped that person to figure out how
to solve it.

To load the packages run:
```{r}
library("xlsx")
library("foreign")
library("dplyr")
library("gmodels")
library("ggplot2")
library("GGally")
library("raster")
library("maptools")
library("broom")
library("gpclib")
```
R-packages have to be installed only once, but loaded every time.
If you use RStudio, you can also install and load the packages through the
`Install` button in the `Packages` tab.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/install_pkgs.png")
```
<!-- ![](images/install_pkgs.png) -->

Today, we will analyze the **Brexit Referendum Results**.  Our goal is to
answer the following questions:
- Which areas voted to remain or to leave?
- Which regions voted to remain or to leave?
- Which were the more divided regions?
- How do the demographic variables correlate with the leave and remain 
  percentage of votes?
  
We want to write a compelling story and creat some nice info graphics to
go with our story. So, let's get started!


## GET

Stretch your arms, grab a coffee `r emo::ji("hotsprings")`, and let's get started 
`r emo::ji("arrow_forward")`!

> Note: You only need to do the first few steps of downloading and reading the data, 
if you want to do it on your computer. Otherwise you can just read the steps and do 
the exercises on this website.

First, let's find the electoral data. 

Today, we will analyze the **Brexit Referendum Results**.  The results data, 
compiled by the Electoral Comission are available in .csv format [here](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/material/lessons/results.csv).

You also want to align it with a dataset which gives various demographic information about regions, in order to try various analyses. We are going to use 2 files: a .dta file (a filetype that you can not open in Excel) that is available [here](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/material/lessons/demographics2.dta)  and a .xlsx file available [here](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/material/lessons/demographics1.xlsx).

These are the columns in the three data sets:

_Results_

- `id` Unique id
- `Region_Code` Region Code
- `Region` Region Name
- `Area_Code` Unique area code
- `Area` Area Name
- `HASC_code` [HASC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_administrative_subdivision_codes) code
- `Electorate` Number of registered voters
- `ExpectedBallots` Expected ballots
- `VerifiedBallotPapers` Verified Ballots
- `Pct_Turnout` Percentage of voter turnout.  VerifiedBallotPapers/Electorate
- `Votes_Cast` Casted Votes
- `Valid_Votes` Number of Valid votes
- `Remain` Number of "Remain" votes
- `Leave` Number of "Leave" votes
- `Rejected_Ballots` Number of rejected ballots

_Demographics1_

- `new_id` unique Id
- `area_code` Unique area code
- `area_name` Area Name
- `median_age` Median age of residents
- `prof_ocu_1`  Percentage of residents with higher and intermediate professional occupations
- `prof_ocu_2`  Percentage of residents with junior professional occupations

_Demographics2_

- `new_id` unique Id
- `area_code` Unique area code
- `area_name` Area Name
- `born_uk` Percentage of residents born in the UK
- `no_educ` Percentage of residents with no formal education
- `higher_educ` Percentage of residents with higher education

Let's download those 3 files and store them in a folder called `electoral-data`.
You must have 3 files in your folder:
`results.cvs`
`demographics1.xlsx`
`demographics2.dta`


Now let's try reading in the data:
1. Open your R editor (e.g. RStudio)
2. Set your working directory to `electoral-data`. To do this enter
```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("/PATH/electoral-data")
```
in the console.
Then, we are going to need two specialised packages to read .dta and .xlsx files into R: `xlsx` and `foreign`.
To load the packages run:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("xlsx")
library("foreign")
```

Now we can read the data:
<!-- Note: I am not actually evaluation this, see what I really do in the "read" chunk -->
```{r read_show, eval=FALSE}
# read results data
results <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/master/material/lessons/results.csv", header = TRUE)

# read demographic data
demographic1 <- read.xlsx("demographics1.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1)
demographic2 <- read.dta("demographics2.dta")
```

<!-- Note: this is what I did to create the RData file, but it needed to be done only once -->
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
results <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/master/material/lessons/results.csv", header = TRUE)

# download data
download.file("https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/material/lessons/demographics1.xlsx?raw=true", destfile = "demographics1.xlsx")
download.file("https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal/blob/master/material/lessons/demographics2.dta?raw=true", destfile = "demographics2.dta")

# read demographic data
demographic1 <- read.xlsx("demographics1.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1)
demographic2 <- read.dta("demographics2.dta")

# spatial info
library("raster")
gbr_sp <- getData("GADM", country = "GBR", level = 2)

# save intermediate results
save(results, demographic1, demographic2, gbr_sp, file = "../../../data/introduction_raw.RData")
```

<!-- Note: this is how I actually load the data, but I don't tell the students ;) -->
```{r read}
# read data
library("ddj")
data(introduction_raw)
```

Note the the hash: it can be used to add comments. You should use it to help future you remember what you did.
Note also than the "string" or text on the left of the <- can be whatever name you want it to be, and the function on the right side of it is assigned to that number. This is what in R is called creating an object and assigning it with a function or value.

See? That was easy! Now you have your data loaded into the program and can start working.

Are you seeing the magic yet?

* A simple line of code can replace cumbersome manual operations that you have to do in Excel to import the data
* R loads all sort of file formats, and doesn't complain
* Write once, reuse several times: Not only you can update your code easily, but you can easily share it with other projects.
* Your stagiaire doesn't know where to find the relevant data? no problem, the links are all in the R code!

**Let's review the commands we learned in this step:**

- Set the folder you work in (working directory) `setwd()`
- Install Packages `install.packages()`
- Load Libraries `library()`
- Read files `read.csv` `read.xlsx` `read.dta`
- Creating objects and assigning values to them
- Add code comments `# my comment`

<!-- > -->

Now let's move on with the analysis!
`r emo::ji("relaxed")`

## VERIFY
Now that you have imported your data into R, it's time to start exploring it.  Here are some useful commands:

- `view()` shows your dataframe with all the variables and observations

- `names()` shows the collumn names of the data frame, e.g. for the `results` data.frame:

```{r ex_look1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "read"}
names(results)

```


Try printing the names of the `demographic1` data.frame.
```{r ex_look2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "read"}

```

```{r ex_look2-solution}
names(demographic1)
```

Check out the names of the `demographic2` data.frame.
```{r ex_look3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "read"}

```

```{r ex_look3-solution, exercise.setup = "read"}
names(demographic2)
```

- `str()` shows the structure of the data set, i.e. the type of each variable 
(here `num` for numeric and `chr` for character) and the first few values

```{r ex_look4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "read"}
str(results)
```

Check out the structure of the `demographic1` and `demographic2` data.frames.

```{r ex_look5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "read"}

```

```{r ex_look5-solution}
str(demographic1)
str(demographic2)
```

- `summary()` gives a summary of all columns in the data.frame

```{r ex_look6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "read"}
summary(results)
```

Check out the summary of the `demographic1` and `demographic2` data.frames.

```{r ex_look7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "read"}

```

```{r ex_look7-solution}
summary(demographic1)
summary(demographic2)
```

Now that you know the variables of your databases is time to start with the cleaning part.


## CLEAN
Before you can start your analysis, you need a clean database with all the information. At this point you have the information scattered in 3 different data.frames (`results`, `demographic1` and `demographic2`), which you would like to combine.

Our objective is to add the demographic variables `median_age` `prof_ocu_1` `prof_ocu_2` `born_uk` `no_educ` and `higher_educ` to the results database.  But in order to do this, we need a common variable in all the datasets.  In the previous step, where we explored the data you can see that the three databases have the variable: `area_code`.

That common variable will allow us to merge the databases using the `merge()` function.

The following lines of code will merge the data sets. Add one line that shows 
the variable names of all variables in the new data set called `mydata`.
```{r ex_merge, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "read"}
## merge the data sets
mydata <- merge(results, demographic1, by.x = "Area_Code", by.y = "area_code")
mydata <- merge(mydata, demographic2, by.x = "Area_Code", by.y = "area_code")

## list all variables in mydata
```

```{r ex_merge-solution, exercise.setup = "read"}
## merge the data sets
mydata <- merge(results, demographic1, by.x = "Area_Code", by.y = "area_code")
mydata <- merge(mydata, demographic2, by.x = "Area_Code", by.y = "area_code")

## list all variables in mydata
names(mydata)
```

```{r merge, echo=FALSE}
data(introduction_raw, package = "ddj")

## merge the data sets
mydata <- merge(results, demographic1, by.x = "Area_Code", by.y = "area_code")
mydata <- merge(mydata, demographic2, by.x = "Area_Code", by.y = "area_code")
```
You now have a new dataframe `mydata` with the electoral and the demographic information. 

For the analysis we also need the percentage of Remain, Leave and Rejected votes for each area.  
This is how we create the three new variables needed (we call them `perc_remain`, `perc_leave` and `perc_rejected`):
```{r perc}
mydata$perc_remain <- (mydata$Remain / mydata$Valid_Votes) * 100
mydata$perc_leave <- (mydata$Leave / mydata$Valid_Votes) * 100
mydata$perc_rejected <- (mydata$Rejected_Ballots / mydata$Votes_Cast) * 100
```
Also we want to sum `prof_ocu_1` and `prof_ocu_2` to create a new variable that contains the percentage of residents in each area with professional occupations:
```{r prof}
mydata$prof_ocu <- mydata$prof_ocu_1 + mydata$prof_ocu_2
```
We can also create a new categorical variable `result` that shows which areas voted to leave and which voted to remain. 
To do this we use the `ifelse()` function. 
```{r res}
## This fuction creates a new variable that asigns the value 1 if the remain percentage is less than 50,
## and 0 otherwise
mydata$result <- ifelse(mydata$perc_remain < 50, 1, 0)
```

To look at the number of areas who voted for and against remaining we can use the `table()` function. Try it!
```{r prep_table, echo=FALSE}
data(introduction_raw, package = "ddj")

## merge the data sets
mydata <- merge(results, demographic1, by.x = "Area_Code", by.y = "area_code")
mydata <- merge(mydata, demographic2, by.x = "Area_Code", by.y = "area_code")

mydata$perc_remain <- (mydata$Remain / mydata$Valid_Votes) * 100
mydata$perc_leave <- (mydata$Leave / mydata$Valid_Votes) * 100
mydata$perc_rejected <- (mydata$Rejected_Ballots / mydata$Votes_Cast) * 100
mydata$prof_ocu <- mydata$prof_ocu_1 + mydata$prof_ocu_2
mydata$result <- ifelse(mydata$perc_remain < 50, 1, 0)
```


```{r ex_tab, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "prep_table"}
## Table of the result
```
```{r ex_tab-solution, exercise.setup = "prep_table"}
## Table of the result
table(mydata$result)
```
Now we can add labels to the variable `Result`
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#Adding labels to 'Result'
mydata$result <- factor(mydata$result,
                        levels = c(1, 0),
                        labels = c("leave", "remain"))

## Table of the result
table(mydata$result)
```

```{r ex_tab2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "prep_table"}
#Adding labels to 'Result'
mydata$result <- factor(mydata$result,
                        levels = c(1, 0),
                        labels = c("leave", "remain"))

## Table of the result
table(mydata$result)
```
See the difference from before?

We can also create a new categorical variable that allows to group the Remain vote in different categories:
```{r}
## create 4 categories of voting percentages
mydata$Remain_cat <- cut(mydata$perc_remain, breaks = c(0, 25, 50, 75, 100))
table(mydata$Remain_cat)
```
Now we can add labels to the variable `Remain_cat`, just as we did for `result` before:
```{r}
mydata$Remain_cat <- factor(mydata$Remain_cat, labels = c("very low", "low", "high", "very high"))
table(mydata$Remain_cat)
```


We are almost done `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`, don't give up just yet! 

To finish, we want to aggregate regional data in new variables, in order the see the voting results by region. A simple way to do this is with the `summarise()` function from the `dplyr` package. If you don't have the package installed, install it with the command `install.packages("dplyr")`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library("dplyr")

## Aggregate per HASC code
datahasc <- summarise(group_by(mydata, HASC_code),    ## Group mydata by HASC code
                      Valid_Votes = sum(Valid_Votes), ## Create a variable Valid_Votes which is the number of valid votes per HASC code, i.e. the sum of valid votes in the areas of the HASC code
                      Remain = sum(Remain),           ## Number of remain votes per HASC code
                      Leave = sum(Leave))             ## Number of Leave votes per HASC code

## Calculate the percentages
datahasc$perc_remain <- (datahasc$Remain / datahasc$Valid_Votes)*100
datahasc$perc_leave <- (datahasc$Leave/ datahasc$Valid_Votes)*100

datahasc
```

<!-- Note: this saves the data used in the following steps (needs to be run only the first time) -->
```{r save_clean, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
save(mydata, datahasc, file = "../../../data/introduction_clean.RData")
```

```{r read_clean}
data(introduction_clean, package = "ddj")
```

This code is a bit difficult to understand. Feel free to play around with it
to understand what is happening. You cant break anything!
```{r hasc, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
library("dplyr")

## Aggregate per HASC code
datahasc <- summarise(group_by(mydata, HASC_code),    ## Group mydata by HASC code
                      Valid_Votes = sum(Valid_Votes), ## Create a variable Valid_Votes which is the number of valid votes per HASC code, i.e. the sum of valid votes in the areas of the HASC code
                      Remain = sum(Remain),           ## Number of remain votes per HASC code
                      Leave = sum(Leave))             ## Number of Leave votes per HASC code

## Calculate the percentages
datahasc$perc_remain <- (datahasc$Remain / datahasc$Valid_Votes)*100
datahasc$perc_leave <- (datahasc$Leave/ datahasc$Valid_Votes)*100

summary(datahasc)
```


Now that you have cleaned your data, you're ready to start the analysis!

```{r convinced, echo=FALSE}
question("Are you convinced yet that R is worth your time?",
  answer("not really"),
  answer("hmmm, I need to see more to decide"),
  answer("yes, R won my heart", correct = TRUE),
  correct = "Wohooo!", incorrect = "Well, maybe the next section will convince you ;)"
)
```


**Let's list some advantages of R so far:**

* With simple lines of code you can rearrange your data, create new variables, delete observations
* Something went wrong? Don't worry, just fix your code, run it and the error goes away easily
* You can keep your original datafiles in the workspace if you need to review them.


**Let's review what we learned in this step:**

- Merge datasets
- Create new variables
- Create new categorical variables and asign labels
- Create a new data set with summaries of an existing data set


## ANALYZE
Let's start with the most fun part. You need to write a story based on those electoral results, and you already have some questions
you want to answer:

- Which areas voted to remain or to leave?
- Which regions?
- Which were the more divided regions?
- How do the demographic variables correlate with the leave and remain percentage of votes?

Let's remind ourselves how many areas voted remain and leave respectively.
```{r tabres1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
## How many areas voted to remain or leave
table(mydata$result)
```
```{r tabres2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
## What percentage of areas voted to remain or leave
prop.table(table(mydata$result))
```
You can see that 69% of the areas voted to leave the European Union.  
Now let's see how are they are distributed by Region creating a two frequency table that shows row percentages.  To do that we are going to use the `CrossTab()` function in the `gmodels` package (rember to install it with `install.packages("gmodels")`):
```{r crosstab, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
library("gmodels")
CrossTable(mydata$Region, mydata$result, digits=3, max.width = 5, expected = FALSE,
           prop.r = TRUE, prop.c = FALSE, prop.t = FALSE, prop.chisq = FALSE)

# Note that we set the prop.r = TRUE in order to show row percetages.
# If we wanted for instance to show column percentages
# we can set prop.c = TRUE
```
With that table you can see that the only regions in wich the majority of areas 
voted to remain in the EU are located in London, Scotland
and Northern Ireland.  This could be interesting for your story!

We can also calculate some summary statistics for the `perc_remain` variable:
```{r summary_pr1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
summary(mydata$perc_remain)
```
```{r summary_pr2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
table(mydata$Remain_cat)
```
You can see that only one area had a very low vote to Remain with 24.4% of the vote.

We can also tabulate the 10 areas with the highest Leave vote:
```{r highest_leave, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
## order data by percentage of leave votes
order_leave <- order(mydata$perc_leave, decreasing = TRUE)
mydata <- mydata[order_leave, ]

## show the first 10 observations, show only some of the variables
mydata[1:10, c("Region", "Area", "Leave", "Remain", "perc_leave")]
```
So far you have answered some of your questions: the majority of areas in the UK voted to leave the EU.  London, Scotland and Northern Ireland voted by majority to Remain.

So it's time to go deeper in the analysis.  We can calculate some correlations between the leave vote and some of the demographic variables.  The hyphotesis is that the regions with older population, less educated residents and less diverse voted to Leave the EU.

Now let's calculate some correlations.  To calculate a correlation between two variables just use the fuction `cor()`. 
```{r cor1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
cor(mydata$perc_leave, mydata$no_educ)
```
You can plot the two variables using the `plot()` function.
```{r cor2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
plot(perc_leave ~ no_educ, data = mydata)
```


To see if our correlation is statistically significant we can use a linear model:
```{r cor3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
### look at Pr(<|t|) in the no_educ row. The p-value is very small
### => statistically significant linear relation between no_educ and perc_leave
model <- lm(perc_leave ~ no_educ, data = mydata)
summary(model)

### visualise the estimated relation
plot(perc_leave ~ no_educ, data = mydata)
abline(model)
```


To calculate a correlation matrix, let's create a new dataframe only with the 
varaibles we need and then use the `cor()` function again:
```{r cor4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_clean"}
corvars <- c("perc_leave", "perc_remain", "median_age", "born_uk",
             "no_educ", "higher_educ", "prof_ocu")
data_cor <- mydata[, corvars]


#Lets calculate the correlation matrix
cor(data_cor)
```
You can see that there's a positive correlation between the Remain vote and the areas with a high number of residents with higher education and professional occupations.  On the contrary, there seem to be a positive correlation between the areas with a higher proportion of no educated residents and the leave vote.

*Don't forget: Correlation DOES NOT imply causation!!

But wait, we can understand the data better if we plot a correlation matrix.  
To do that we need the package `GGally` and the package `ggplot2`:

Now you have some interesting insights and can start writing your story! 
But wait! We actually have some more great visualisations prepared for you in the
next section.

**Let's review the commands we learned in this step:**

- `table()`, `prop.table()` and `CrossTable()` for tables
- `order()` for retrieving the order of a variable
- `cor()` for correlation
- `plot()` for simple plot of two variables and `ggpairs()` for a correlation 
plot
- `lm()` for computing a linear model and `abline()` for ploting the estimated
relation between two variables



## PRESENT
<!-- https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/49832 helped me here -->

A common task in the work of a journalist is to bring the results into a form
that is nice to look at. Often this form is a map.  For this we need a couple
of packages:
```{r}
## remeber to install all packages
## with install.packages()
library("raster")
library("maptools")
library("broom")
library("ggplot2")
```

Maps are complicated and on some computers the code below won't work. A fix is to use
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("gpclib")
gpclibPermit()
```
BUT the licence for gpclib is not Free or Open Source and explicitly forbids
commercial use, which is why we recommend not to use it if not needed.


Now let's get started: First we need to get the spatial data needed to create a
map. `getData` can get you geographic data from all over the world from different
sources. We use [GADM.org](http://www.gadm.org/) as a source here. The country of
interest is Great Britain (GBR) and we need info on 2nd level administrative
subdivision. Check out what other geographic information you can get by typing
`?raster::getData` into the R console.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## get the spatial data for Great Britain (GBR)
gbr_sp <- getData("GADM", country = "GBR", level = 2)
```

Next, we convert the data to a data frame we can work with (this is just
a technical detail you don't need to understand at this point):
```{r}
gbr <- fortify(gbr_sp, region = "HASC_2")
str(gbr)
```

```{r read_sp}
library("raster")
library("maptools")
library("broom")
library("ggplot2")
data(introduction_raw, package = "ddj")
gbr <- fortify(gbr_sp, region = "HASC_2")
```



Our data set `datahasc` has no detailed info on the districts in Northern Ireland
(check out for yourself `datahasc$HASC_code`) so we have to change the HASC code (gbr$id)
for these districts to just "Northern Ireland" to be able to merge the geographical data
with the voting results.
```{r spatial, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_sp"}
# (1) get data from spatial object which contains info on HASC code and which
#     of the codes correspond to Northern Ireland
mapdat <- gbr_sp@data

# (2) get the HASC codes that correspond to Northern Ireland
NI_HASC <- mapdat$HASC_2[mapdat$NAME_1 == "Northern Ireland"]

# (3) change the relevant HASC codes in gbr to "Northern Ireland"
gbr$id[gbr$id %in% NI_HASC] <- "Northern Ireland"
str(gbr)
```

```{r read_sp2, echo = FALSE}
library("raster")
library("maptools")
library("broom")
library("ggplot2")
data(introduction_raw, package = "ddj")
gbr <- fortify(gbr_sp, region = "HASC_2")

# (1) get data from spatial object which contains info on HASC code and which
#     of the codes correspond to Northern Ireland
mapdat <- gbr_sp@data

# (2) get the HASC codes that correspond to Northern Ireland
NI_HASC <- mapdat$HASC_2[mapdat$NAME_1 == "Northern Ireland"]

# (3) change the relevant HASC codes in gbr to "Northern Ireland"
gbr$id[gbr$id %in% NI_HASC] <- "Northern Ireland"
```

Now we can merge
```{r merge_spatial, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_sp2"}
## Merge the map data with the brexit data for the HASC areas we created earlier
gbr_brexit <- merge(gbr, datahasc, by.x = "id", by.y = "HASC_code", all.x = TRUE)
```


For plotting spatial data it is important that the order is correct. Let's get
the order right: Fortunately we have a variable `order` in our gbr_brexit data 
set (you always get the order with the geographic data, see `str(gbr)`).
The function `order()` gives us the info on how we need to reorder our data set:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
## Merge the map data with the brexit data for the HASC areas we created earlier
gbr_brexit <- merge(gbr, datahasc, by.x = "id", by.y = "HASC_code", all.x = TRUE)
```

```{r}
head(gbr_brexit)
ord <- order(gbr_brexit$order)
gbr_brexit <- gbr_brexit[ord, ]
head(gbr_brexit)
```

```{r read_sp3, echo = FALSE}
library("raster")
library("maptools")
library("broom")
library("ggplot2")
data(introduction_raw, package = "ddj")
gbr <- fortify(gbr_sp, region = "HASC_2")

# (1) get data from spatial object which contains info on HASC code and which
#     of the codes correspond to Northern Ireland
mapdat <- gbr_sp@data

# (2) get the HASC codes that correspond to Northern Ireland
NI_HASC <- mapdat$HASC_2[mapdat$NAME_1 == "Northern Ireland"]

# (3) change the relevant HASC codes in gbr to "Northern Ireland"
gbr$id[gbr$id %in% NI_HASC] <- "Northern Ireland"

## Merge the map data with the brexit data for the HASC areas we created earlier
gbr_brexit <- merge(gbr, datahasc, by.x = "id", by.y = "HASC_code", all.x = TRUE)

ord <- order(gbr_brexit$order)
gbr_brexit <- gbr_brexit[ord, ]
```

Now we can plot the map. `ggplot` is like lego bricks. In this case our foundation
is the `gbr_brexit` data. Longitude and latitude variables (`long` and `lat`) go
on the x and y axes, `group` is a variable with the geographic details needed and
we want to color (`fill`) the administrative divisions according to the percentage
of remain votes `perc_remain`. `geom_polygon` is responsible for plotting the
colored polygons (this may take some time):
```{r pl1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_sp3"}
ggplot(data = gbr_brexit, 
       aes(x = long, y = lat, 
           group = group, 
           fill = perc_remain)) +
  geom_polygon()
```


But this map is not quite correct, we need to make sure that it has the right proportions:
```{r pl2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_sp3"}
ggplot(data = gbr_brexit,
       aes(x = long, y = lat, 
           group = group, 
           fill = perc_remain)) +
  geom_polygon() + coord_map()
```

Also it seems like the x axis is a bit too long, let's shorten it:
```{r pl3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_sp3"}
ggplot(data = gbr_brexit,
       aes(x = long, y = lat, 
           group = group, 
           fill = perc_remain)) +
  geom_polygon() + coord_map() + xlim(-10, NA)
```

We can now add nicer x- and y-axis labels as well as the legend title:
```{r pl4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "read_sp3"}
ggplot(data = gbr_brexit,
       aes(x = long, y = lat, 
           group = group, 
           fill = perc_remain)) +
  geom_polygon() + coord_map() + xlim(-10, NA) + 
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude",
       fill = "Percentage\nRemain") # pro tip: \n creates a line break
```
TADA!
